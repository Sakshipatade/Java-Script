difference between let and var 



the major difference between let and var is
let is only for block scope


and var is for global scope 


//let us take an example of var 


var x = 10;
if(true){
	document.write(x); //x will be accessed here
}
document.write(x); //it will access here too



let x = 10;

if(true){
	document.write(x); //x will not access here
}

document.write(x); //it will be accessed here

The difference between for loop and for each loop is as follows:


for loop has all control over loop. but it need to initialize all the terms like index, condition and increment/decrement

for each loop automatically handle this and handle index and it iterate through each item insteadly.
